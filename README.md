# Hackathon Project 🚀

Pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model with it. 

## Timeline

- By 11:15am ET, Slack the instructional team your 1-line problem statement and a link to your dataset. We will give you a thumbs up or ask questions/make suggestions.
- Commit and push regularly.
- By 5:00pm ET, make your final push to your GitHub submission repo. We'll do 5-minute lightning talks where you'll tell the class what you found. No slides necessary - you can quickly walk us through a Jupyter notebook. 

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. But you will be amazed what you can accomplish in a day! 

We're not expecting anything as polished as previous projects. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least one real (non-baseline) model fit and scored. It does not have to score well.

Make a baseline model model. Then start with a super simple model for your first real model. Don't be afraid to use a subset of the data for faster iteration when you are working out your modeling process.

If you have a large data file, keep it out of GitHub by using your _.gitignore_ file. ⚠️

## Datasets 

You can pick any dataset you're interested in. We suggest not picking a dataset that will take several hours to clean. Picking multiple datasets to merge is not advised unless you are comfortable that this will go smoothly. Do not use your capstone or group project datasets.

You may not use the same dataset as someone else, so first come, first served.

Your dataset and problem do not need to be novel, but please do not pick a dataset that you have used before or that is extremely common in data science examples (such as Titanic, Iris, MNIST, etc.). 

There are many curated collections of interesting datasets online. Here are a few links to get you started:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [/r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)
- [Data is Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)

Reminder: do not duplicate someone else's work and give credit where credit is due.

## Rubric

- [ ] Perform basic EDA (examples: report summary statistics, use visuals to explore your dataset)
- [ ] If necessary, perform basic data cleaning (examples: handle null values, clean data entry errors)
- [ ] Make a baseline model
- [ ] Fit and evaluate at least one model

## Have fun! 🎉
